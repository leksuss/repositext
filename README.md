# Repositext

Content management server written with Python/Django.

## Development

### A word to the interested developer

This project is mainly for fun and learning. It's not particularly ambitious. As such, it is perfect for those who would like to get their feet wet in being a worker among workers and getting some pratice in a real world app that may potentially have some merit. Content management is not a particularly sexy field of software but one that is necessary for most businesses. My hope is that this will have most everything you will encounter when working on a Django project and should be useful for anyone looking to learn more.

If you're new to working on open source projects and not sure how to get your environment locally set up, have a look at "How to setup for deployment and read all of it. You may not need to know all of it from the start but hopefully you will know where to go to in case you run into issues.

### How to setup for development

* Install Python 3.8.2 -- Using pyenv (see https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) is highly recommended.
* Clone this repo to a folder.

```
# git clone git@github.com:hseritt/repositext.git
```

* Change to the project directory (repositext).
* Install the packages in environment/requirements.txt:

```
# pip install -r environment/requirements.txt
```

You may run into an issue with installing graphviz. A quick way to solve that is by installing the graphviz-dev package.

```
# sudo apt-get install graphviz-dev
```

#### Project database

Be aware that you can use any database you like (even SQLite3 if you don't have a db server configured) but the project is set up to use MySQL by default. Just make sure that your local environment uses a local settings.py that doesn't get added to any branch you're working on (hint: put your settings-\*.py file in the .gitignore file).

I've included a sample MySQL and Postgresql settings in the repositext settings folder. I've also added functionality that allows you to put a local.py in the project root directory where you can put a pointer (project_settings in this example below) that will be used with the project scripts (like reset-data.sh, runserver.sh, etc.). Add it like so and save as local.py:

```python

project_settings = 'repositext.settings-local'

```

*This will point to a local settings file called repositext.settings-local.py.*

Be aware that local.py has been added to the .gitignore file so your local.py should not cause any issues with the project code.

#### Running the development server

* Run the project:

```
# ./manage.py runserver
```

or you can use the handy runserver.sh script that includes environment information:

```
# ./runserver.sh [ use any normal options for manage.py runserver ]
```

You'll likely see a warning message saying that models may need to be migrated.

To migrate the database, create a superuser and fill the db with some sample data, you can run reset-data.sh.

```
# ./reset-data.sh
```

Assuming you have a MySQL database configured, it will, out of the box, add a -ROOT- directory inside the UI along with a few sample subfolders and documents.

But, if you prefer, you can do the manual setting up of the database.

You can do that with these commands (this is required at a minimum if you don't run reset-data.sh):

```
# ./manage.py makemigrations
# ./manage.py migrate
```

After starting the development server, you can access http://localhost:8000/docweb/ or http://localhost:8000/admin/ if desired.

In order to use the admin console, you'll need to set up a superuser like so (know that the reset-data.sh script will do this for you):

```
# ./manage.py createsuperuser
```

Follow the directions and you should then have a superuser login with password.


Once you have Repositext running if you did not run reset-data.sh, you will run into a folder not found when you open http://localhost:8000/docweb/. You will need to add a folder called '-ROOT-' (with no parent) in the admin console.

![Add root folder in django admin](docs/screenshots/add_root_folder.png)

Next, to continue developing it would be good to create two more folders which are children of the -ROOT- folder:

![Add root folder in django admin](docs/screenshots/add_test_folder1.png)

![Add root folder in django admin](docs/screenshots/add_test_folder1.png)

As previously mentioned, there is a script called reset-data.sh that will do all of these things:

* Recreate/create the database (assumes you've set up the database properly in settings.py)
* Runs makemigrations and migrate
* Creates a superuser with username of admin and password of admin.
* Adds the -ROOT- folder and a few test folders.
* Will also add some test documents.

To run it, call ./reset-data.sh.
